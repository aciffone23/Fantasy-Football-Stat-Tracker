Background

The core functionality of this project revolves around tracking specific players' data and displaying their statistics in an intuitive pop-up window. Users can select their desired players, and the application will fetch the relevant data, presenting it in a visually engaging format. The interactive pop-up window showcases essential stats such as points scored, yards gained, touchdowns, and more, facilitating a deeper understanding of each player's contribution to their fantasy football team. By providing a comprehensive overview of individual player performance, this project empowers users to optimize their roster management and dominate their leagues.
